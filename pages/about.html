    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="columns-container">
        <p class="side-text">
            I was born in New Mexico to Donna and Jan-Willem Briedé. My mother grew up a Unitarian in Wilmington,
            Delaware. My father is Dutch and grew up on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao. My parents met in the
            Netherlands and have been married since 1977. Early in their married life, they worked in international
            development on agricultural projects. Perhaps the most harrowing story from their young adulthood was living
            through the 1978-1979 Uganda-Tanzania War, which ended in the overthrow of the dictator Idi Amin. I spent
            much of my childhood entertained by stories of my parents' travels.

            We lived in New Mexico until I was five years old. My parents were active in a small UU house church in
            Gallup, NM. I remember staying in the kitchen with the other children as my parents attended the service in
            the living room. We subsequently moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. Most of my childhood memories come from
            Cincinnati. We lived in a predominantly Catholic, middle-class suburb of the city.

            When I was 12 years old, we moved to Yorktown, Virginia. There, we joined a spiritual community, the
            Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of the Peninsula (UUFP), in Newport News, Virginia. Church felt like home
            to me. I remember liking the sermons and feeling free to express various emotions in church. These emotions
            ranged from dancing joyfully around the maypole outside to crying after listening to a heartfelt story. I
            also gained valuable adult mentors and made friends from outside my school. I was a member of the church's
            middle and high school groups and even joined the young adult group when I visited home from college. I
            still feel a sense of homecoming when I return to the UUFP.

            I attended undergraduate at George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax, Virginia. Interested in politics, I
            joined Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), a leftist group on campus. This was my first exposure to
            protests and the world of organizing. I spent a month as an organizer in New Brunswick, New Jersey, through
            SDS. The campaign sought to increase participatory democracy in New Brunswick. It was in New Brunswick that
            I became a community organizer. I was only there for a month but continued to return on weekends to help the
            campaign throughout my time in college. In college, I advocated for environmental justice through the campus
            environmental action group, engaged in interfaith work for the first time, and participated in the labor
            movement for a semester in New York City and Connecticut.

                During college, I also explored spirituality. I traveled to Taiwan for a month in July 2008 and studied
                at a Buddhist monastery. The Woodenfish Humanistic Buddhist Monastic Life Program provided an
                introductory education in Mahayana Buddhism and monastic life. I loved learning about Buddhism and
                participating in the community's evening chanting service. I gained friends and a network of individuals
                interested in Buddhism from this program.

        The program also introduced me to university meditation groups. It led me to participate in the Columbia
        University Buddhist Association (CUBA) while living in New York City. Upon returning to George Mason, my
        experience with CUBA inspired me to start a Buddhist association at my school. I joined forces with a
        Korean Buddhist student and ran a meditation group until I graduated college in December 2010.
        Additionally, I was an Islamic Studies minor and took classes on Islam, the Middle East, and the Quran.

                After college, I began thinking about my career trajectory. Although I had ministry as my eventual goal,
                I wanted to get exposure to the workforce while helping the world. I served with AmeriCorps for two
                years. I served in Burlington, Vermont, at the Vermont Student Assistance
                Corporation for my first year. In my second year, I served with AmeriCorps National Civilian Community
                Corps (NCCC) as a Team Leader traveling with ten young adults. Our first placement was performing
                disaster relief in New York City after Hurricane Sandy. Our second placement was environmental work on
                Catalina Island in California. AmeriCorps was challenging and highly educational.

        Following AmeriCorps, I worked at the American Red Cross doing disaster relief in Morgantown, West
        Virginia. I learned about rural poverty and Appalachian identity during my two years in Morgantown.
        During all of this, I still felt a call to ministry. I started at Harvard Divinity School in 2015.
        Divinity school was rewarding and helped me grow into my call to UU ministry. I explored Christianity in
        divinity school, including working at a United Church of Christ church for a brief time. I loved that
        community and Christian ritual but could not reconcile my deep sense of agnosticism with that work.
        Instead, I was at home in UU communities like Sanctuary Boston and Arlington Street Church.

            After seminary, I went on to do a Clinical Pastoral Education residency. I improved my pastoral care skills
            during the residency and gained more self-awareness. It became clear that hospital chaplaincy was not my
            calling; I wanted to do parish work. I like building long-term community relationships in a UU church. My
            internship at First Parish Arlington reinforced this idea. I loved my church community and enjoyed serving
            my parishioners. After my training, I served as the Interim Director of Religious Education and Parish
            Administrator at the First Parish in Hingham, MA, Old Ship Church, and as the Interim Minister of the UU
            Community Community Church of Augusta, ME.

            I am currently the Interim Minister at the Pacific Unitarian Universalist Church (PUC) in Rancho Palos
            Verdes, CA. PUC joyfully ordained me in September 2023. I live in Long Beach with my partner, Div, and our
            dog, Dobby. Div is a faculty member at California State University in Fullerton. I am spiritually fed by
            attending Sanctuary Boston online and time in nature. I enjoy hiking, cooking, gardening, and playing board
            games with friends in my free time. I also love to learn about astronomy, physics, and history when I am not
            reading for church.
