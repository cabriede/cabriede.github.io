        Prayer, Pacific Unitarian Church, October 15, 2023
      </h3>
      <p>God and Goddess of the earth,<br>Sun and Moon,<br>Forest and Sea,</p>
      <p>The great spirit that gives life to all,<br>The energy that moves inside of us and between us,<br>From the tiny
        cellular level to the vastness and strength of the waves,</p>
      <p>Spirit, we come together today in prayer.</p>
      <p>Prayer for a world that is aching from war and strife.</p>
      <p>Goddess, we are heartbroken.<br>Heartbroken for the many lives that have been lost this week.<br>Palestinians,
        Israelis, Ukrainians, and Russians to war.<br>Afghanis lost to disaster.</p>
      <p>Goddess, hold us in our grief and lift up our prayers of love with your wind to those who so desperately need
        it right now.</p>
      <p>We also send prayers to those in our midst who are suffering. Those with ongoing illness, new diagnosis, and
        mental anguish. Those who seek forgiveness for harm done or who need to give forgiveness.</p>
      <p>May you be held in the Goddess's loving arms and this community's love.</p>
      <p>Spirit, we also send prayers of hope and joy.<br>Lifting up those who have good news. New jobs, new babies,
        important milestones, and joyful time spent together.</p>
      <p>We are grateful that in the midst of sorrow and pain, there is often hope to be found. Stories of good deeds
        and lives saved. Reminders that the world is not all bad.</p>
      <p>
        Spirit, we pray for all of this—our hurting world, those suffering in our midst, and the great joys that give
        us hope.</p>
      <p>Let us take a moment of silence.</p>
      <p>(silence)</p>
      <p><em>Amen.</em></p>

        Prayer, First Parish in Arlington, MA, May 17, 2020
      </h3>
      <p>
        UU minister Dana Greely described prayer as tuning the finite to the infinite. As opening the heart of humankind
        to the heart of God. Join me in prayer, opening ourselves up to the infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh God of many names, we find ourselves filled with angst and uncertainty. And also with gratitude. We give
        thanks for warm days and a sun that shines so bright, warming the sacred planet we call home. We give thanks for
        the greenery and the beautiful colors that bloom around us. Many of us turning to the grandeur of this earth as
        a reminder of beauty and change as we face ambivalence about the road ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also found peace and stability in family, friends, neighbors and other connections. Old connections made
        anew and those maintained despite the hardship of this moment. We are grateful for those who show us love and
        grace. Those who forgive us and those who remind us to be our best selves, both personally and in the wider
        world. We are thankful for moments of love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spirit of mystery that moves through the universe. We hold uncertainty and grief. As we open our hearts to this
        moment, we are filled with all these emotions. We are so tender. We hold uncertainty and anxiety about our
        future. Uncertainty and concern for those in our communities effected by this pandemic and this economy. We hold
        grief for those we have lost, recently and long ago. Grief for a world that mourns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spirit of life and love. Continue to show us signs that there is goodness to be found. Continue to remind us to
        be grateful. Hold us in the heart of the holy. Let us join together in a minute of silent reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          Amen.

      Prayer, Outdoor Service, First Parish in Arlington, MA, March 15, 2020
    </h3>
    <p>
      We will begin this time by singing "Spirit of Life" twice. I will then offer some words of prayer and invite
      you to name out loud anyone you are holding in your thoughts at this time. We will follow with 30 seconds of
      silent reflection, which I will conclude by saying "Amen." After the "Amen," we will end by singing "Spirit of
      Life" one more time.
    </p>
    <p><em>Spirit of Life (sung twice)</em></p>
    <p>Please join me in prayer.</p>
    <p>
      Spirit of life that stirs in our hearts, join us as we ground ourselves here in this sacred place. We gather,
      rooted together in community, amidst chaos, uncertainty, and anxiety. Spirit, help ground those feeling anxious
      and lost as we confront the challenges of coronavirus. Root those facing difficult decisions, potentially
      leading to grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spirit, help us gather in the branches of our community those feeling on edge or alone. Assist us in embracing
      those who grieve for lost loved ones and those battling illnesses, both visible and hidden. Spirit, enable us to
      be a loving community, especially in these trying times.
    </p>
    <p>Please name out loud those you hold in your heart at this time.</p>
    <p>
      Spirit, send our prayers on the wind and with the clouds. Carry our thoughts to all those we care for. Let our
      prayers gently reach those serving during this time—the nurses, doctors, nurse's assistants, environmental
      workers, emergency responders, and all frontline heroes. We pray for their safety, drawing strength from the
      firm ground beneath us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spirit, ground us. Protect our anxious world. Feeling the stability of the soil beneath us, I invite you into a
      few moments of silence.
    </p>
    <p><em>Amen.</em></p>
